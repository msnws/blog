Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my new blog. This is going to be an incredibly brief post, so donâ€™t expect much here.

Iâ€™m just going to write aboutâ€¦ literally whatever here. I donâ€™t have a particular theme or idea in mind. Soâ€¦ if you want to follow along with me on my strange side tangents and fleeting ADHD-fueled niche interestsâ€¦ then follow along!

*(As a side noteâ€¦ if this blog looks terrible right now, thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m making it in Astro and I was more interested in functionality over aesthetics. The blog kind of needs toâ€¦ work first, right? Give me a minute on the styling. I have a UI framework mostly locked and loaded, but less time than Iâ€™d want to actually implement it.)*
